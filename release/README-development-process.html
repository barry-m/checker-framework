        <h3>Description of the phases and deadlines</h3>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #6d9de9">Development</mark></p>
        <p>During the development phase, arbitrarily large or complex changes may be pushed.</p>
        <p><font color="blue">Feature freeze</font></p>
        <p>By the <em>feature freeze </em>deadline, all new feature code, associated tests, and documentation must be pushed. If a feature is not complete by this time, then it should be delayed until the next release. By this time, all users should update the relevant project&rsquo;s changelog to include features and bug fixes they have made during this development cycle (not including bug fixes made in the two days that follow).</p>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #92c27d">Bug fixing</mark></p>
        <p>During this phase general bugs are fixed. These are minor bugs that may have been discovered (by the new tests or otherwise) in the feature implementation or documentation. You are allowed to fix any bug that you want, add new tests and documentation, etc., during this time. But no new features may be implemented. Example bugs that would be fixed during this phase is anything that is revealed by Jenkins but was not revealed by the test suite itself.</p>
        <p><font color="#6aa74f">Code freeze</font></p>
        <p>By <em>code freeze</em>, the code is assumed to be in a shippable state. Pushes to the repository are no longer allowed.</p>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #d0e0e3">Release</mark></p>
        <p>The person responsible for making the release runs the release scripts and other manual tasks for the release (Note any pushes during this phase force the automated tests to restart and possibly delay the release.)</p>
        <h3>Deadline enforcement</h3>
        <p>The following are only enforced for the main (release) branch:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any large or complex change (i.e. a feature change or a design change) pushed after feature freeze will be reverted.</li>
            <li>Any fix for a bug pushed after code freeze for which an exception was not made will be reverted.</li>
            <li>If a recall class bug is discovered late and its fix is not checked in with enough time for Jenkins tests to complete before Release Day, <strong>then the release is delayed</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>Every month, the person appointed to run the release process will e-mail Mike to discuss what events are coming up in the following few months that may impact the typical monthly milestone cadence. These may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A new JDK release</li>
            <li>Conferences/talks</li>
            <li>An IDE release (less likely to impact our schedule)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After getting a response from Mike, the release process person will add the planned feature freeze, code freeze and release dates for the following two months to the Checker Framework calendar, and will send an e-mail to the checker-dev mailing list with these dates. Additionally the release process person will e-mail checker-dev 2 business days prior to each deadline reminding users of the requirements in this document for that deadline. He or she must also ensure that all <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects under &quot;CF Release&quot;</a> are green prior to <em>code freeze </em>and notify owners of the test projects if this is not the case. If you are the release person for a given month, I recommend you push your bug fixes at least two days prior to the code freeze deadline - this is because you are likely to be helping other people make their Jenkins projects become green during that period.</p>
        <p><strong>Important: </strong>Immediately after <mark>feature freeze</mark>, the release person must ensure that the changelogs for the Checker Framework, Type Annotations Compiler and AFU are complete, <mark>and that the changelogs for the Checker Framework and Type Annotations Compiler are written and is vetted by Mike. Do not send a proposed release e-mail to Mike - instead, just ask him to vet the changelogs that are checked in.</mark> This ensures that there are no delays in either releasing the products due to incomplete changelogs or in sending the announcement e-mail. Don't forget to warn users that they must have changelogs done by feature freeze.</p>
        <p>The reason we must ask Mike to look at the changelogs right after feature freeze (instead of code freeze) is that we now no longer have a "recall class" bug period, so there are now only two days between feature freeze and the release. If anyone fixes a bug that is worth mentioning as more than a number, the changelog can be amended accordingly and Mike can be warned about it.</p>
        <p><strong>A note on release version numbers: </strong>It is <em>strongly discouraged </em>to not update the release version numbers for the Checker Framework and jsr308-langtools even if no changes were made to these in a month. This would break so much in the release scripts that they would become unusable. For the AFU, I recommend trying to include a small bug fix or doc update in every release so we can update the version number, but when that is not possible, the release person must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that they are subscribed to the AFU push notifications mailing list</li>
            <li>Verify that the AFU changelog has not been changed</li>
            <li>Grep all the AFU pages on the dev web site for the release date with patterns such as "29.*Aug" and "Aug.*29" and fix them to match the previous release date.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind that in this case, the release scripts will fail in certain places and the release person must manually follow a few remaining release steps.</p>
        <h3><mark>Performance verification</mark></h3>
        <p><mark>The release person must ensure that all <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects under &quot;CF Release&quot;</a> do not have performance regressions compared to the previous release (this list may be narrowed down to fewer projects in the future). This must be done twice:</mark></p>
        <ul>
            <li><mark>The morning after Feature Freeze, since features are more likely than bug fixes to have introduced a performance regression and since these regressions could potentially be fixed during the bug fix period.</mark></li>
            <li><mark>The morning after Code Freeze, since bug fixes may have introduced performance regressions (though this is less likely). If this happens, the decision needs to be made whether to back out the bug fix, ship with the performance regression, or make a recall-class bug fix to address the performance issue.</mark></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bug triaging</h3>
        <p>The release person is responsible for triaging incoming Checker Framework bugs (on a daily basis or as they come in). They must ensure that each bug is assigned to the appropriate person and that it has been given a priority. They must also keep track of bugs being resolved to ensure that there is a reproducible test case for them.</p>
        <p><mark>One week before Feature Freeze, the release person must remind bug owners of their bugs outstanding.</mark></p>
        <h3><mark>Update lists of checkers in the manual</mark></h3>
        <p><mark>The morning after Feature Freeze, please verify that the lists of checkers in these chapter sections are up to date:</mark></p>
        <ul>
            <li><mark><a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#introduction">Introduction</a></mark></li>
            <li><mark><a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#type-refinement-runtime-tests">Run-time tests and type refinement</a></mark></li>
        </ul>
        <p><mark>I also recommend adding any new checkers to the Eclipse plug-in at this point, rather than waiting to do it on release day.</mark></p>
