        <h3>Description of the phases and deadlines</h3>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #6d9de9">Development</p>
        <p>During the development phase, arbitrarily large or complex changes may be pushed.</p>
        <p><font color="blue">Feature freeze</font></p>
        <p>By the <em>feature freeze </em>deadline, all new feature code, associated tests, and documentation
        must be pushed. If a feature is not complete by this time, then it should be delayed until the next
        release. By this time, all users should update the relevant project&rsquo;s changelog to include
        features and bug fixes they have made during this development cycle (not including bug fixes made
        in the two days that follow).</p>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #92c27d">Bug fixing</p>
        <p>During this phase general bugs are fixed. These are minor bugs that may have been discovered
        (by the new tests or otherwise) in the feature implementation or documentation. You are allowed
        to fix any bug that you want, add new tests and documentation, etc., during this time. But no
        new features may be implemented. Example bugs that would be fixed during this phase is anything
        that is revealed by Jenkins but was not revealed by the test suite itself.</p>
        <p><font color="#6aa74f">Code freeze</font></p>
        <p>By <em>code freeze</em>, the code is assumed to be in a shippable state. Pushes to the
        repository are no longer allowed.</p>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #d0e0e3">Release</p>
        <p>The person responsible for making the release runs the release scripts and other manual tasks
        for the release (Note any pushes during this phase force the automated tests to restart and
        possibly delay the release.)</p>
        <h3>Deadline enforcement</h3>
        <p>The following are only enforced for the main (release) branch:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any large or complex change (i.e. a feature change or a design change) pushed after
            feature freeze will be reverted.</li>
            <li>Any fix for a bug pushed after code freeze for which an exception was not made will be reverted.</li>
            <li>If a recall class bug is discovered late and its fix is not checked in with enough time
            for Jenkins tests to complete before Release Day, <strong>then the release is delayed</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>The release process person will plan the feature freeze, code freeze and release dates for the
        following two months, add these to the Checker Framework calendar, and send an e-mail to the
        checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev mailing lists with these dates.
        Additionally the release process person will e-mail the mailing lists 2 business days prior to each
        deadline reminding users of the requirements in this document for that deadline. He or she must also
        ensure that all <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects
        under &quot;CF Release&quot;</a> are green prior to <em>code freeze </em>and notify owners of the
        test projects if this is not the case. If you are the release person for a given month, I recommend
        you push your bug fixes at least two days prior to the code freeze deadline - this is because you
        are likely to be helping other people make their Jenkins projects become green during that period.</p>
        <p><strong>Important: </strong>Immediately after feature freeze, the release person must ensure that
        the changelogs for the Checker Framework, Type Annotations Compiler and AFU are complete, and that
        the changelogs for the Checker Framework and Type Annotations Compiler are written and is vetted
        by Mike. Do not send a proposed release e-mail to Mike - instead, just ask him to vet the changelogs
        that are checked in. This ensures that there are no delays in either releasing the products due to
        incomplete changelogs or in sending the announcement e-mail. Don't forget to warn users that they
        must have changelogs done by feature freeze.</p>
        <p>The reason we must ask Mike to look at the changelogs right after feature freeze (instead of
        code freeze) is that we now no longer have a "recall class" bug period, so there are now only two
        days between feature freeze and the release. If anyone fixes a bug that is worth mentioning as more
        than a number, the changelog can be amended accordingly and Mike can be warned about it.</p>
        <p><strong>A note on release version numbers: </strong>It is <em>strongly discouraged </em>to not
        update the release version numbers for the Checker Framework and jsr308-langtools even if no changes
        were made to these in a month. This would break so much in the release scripts that they would
        become unusable. For the AFU, I recommend trying to include a small bug fix or doc update in every
        release so we can update the version number, but when that is not possible, the release person must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that they are subscribed to the AFU push notifications mailing list</li>
            <li>Verify that the AFU changelog has not been changed</li>
            <li>Grep all the AFU pages on the dev web site for the release date with patterns such as "29.*Aug"
            and "Aug.*29" and fix them to match the previous release date.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind that in this case, the release scripts will fail in certain places and the release person
        must manually follow a few remaining release steps.</p>
        <h3>Performance verification</h3>
        <p>The release person must ensure that all
        <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects under &quot;CF Release&quot;</a>
        do not have performance regressions compared to the previous release (this list may be narrowed down to fewer
        projects in the future). This must be done twice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The morning after Feature Freeze, since features are more likely than bug fixes to have
            introduced a performance regression and since these regressions could potentially be fixed
            during the bug fix period.</li>
            <li>The morning after Code Freeze, since bug fixes may have introduced performance regressions
            (though this is less likely). If this happens, the decision needs to be made whether to back
            out the bug fix, ship with the performance regression, or make a recall-class bug fix to
            address the performance issue.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bug triaging</h3>
        <p>The release person is responsible for triaging incoming Checker Framework bugs (on a daily
        basis or as they come in). They must ensure that each bug is assigned to the appropriate person
        and that it has been given a priority. They must also keep track of bugs being resolved to ensure
        that there is a reproducible test case for them.</p>
        <p>One week before Feature Freeze, the release person must remind bug owners of their bugs
        outstanding.</p>
        <h3>Update lists of checkers in the manual</h3>
        <p>The morning after Feature Freeze, please verify that the lists of checkers in these chapter
        sections are up to date:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#introduction">Introduction</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#type-refinement-runtime-tests">Run-time tests and type refinement</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also recommend adding any new checkers to the Eclipse plug-in at this point,
        rather than waiting to do it on release day.</p>
